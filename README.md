# libft_42
small libft library.
This projects seeks to build on the concepts learned during the c piscine 
(bootcamp), to code a library of useful functions that will be allowed to be 
reused in future projects. Because we don't have access to those highly 
useful standard functions, we have to re-write those functions, to understand
them and to learn how to use them currently.
### Compiling

Run the following commands:

* To compile
	- `make`
* To remove objects:
	- `make clean`
* To remove objects and binary file (program):
	- `make fclean`
* To re-compile:
	- `make re`

### Executing

To test the library, compile with your program. i.e.

`./program libft.a`
